	# Exercise: Data Wrangling with dplyr — Part 1
	# Dataset: ggplot2::mpg
	
	# Estimated time: 30 minutes
	
	# Learning goals:
	
	# By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:
	# - filter rows with filter()
	# - select columns with select()
	# - reorder columns with relocate()
	# - rename columns with rename() and rename_with()
	# - create and modify variables with mutate()
	# - summarize data with summarise()
	# - calculate summaries by groups with group_by() and summarise()
	# - combine multiple dplyr functions in a single pipeline
	
	# Instructions:
	# 1. Write your code below each question.
	# 2. Use descriptive object names written in snake_case.
	# 3. Run your script from top to bottom before you finish.
	# 4. Do not delete the questions or instructions - these will help you later.

	# We will use the mpg dataset from {ggplot2}.
	# It contains fuel economy information for 234 vehicle models.
	#
	# Some important variables:
	# manufacturer = vehicle manufacturer
	# model        = vehicle model
	# displ        = engine displacement, in liters
	# year         = model year
	# cyl          = number of cylinders
	# trans        = transmission
	# drv          = drivetrain: f = front-wheel, r = rear-wheel, 4 = 4-wheel
	# cty          = city miles per gallon
	# hwy          = highway miles per gallon
	# class        = vehicle class
	
	
	
	# Take a quick look at the dataset.

	# Part 1: filter()

	# 1. Create an object called efficient_cars that contains only
	# vehicles with highway fuel economy of at least 30 mpg.

	# ============================================================
	# Part 2: select()

	# 5. Create a smaller dataset called mpg_small containing only:
	# manufacturer, model, class, displ, cty, hwy
	
	mpg |>
	  select(manufacturer, model, displ, cty, hwy)

	# 6. Starting with mpg, select:

	# Do this using : rather than writing every variable name.

	# Hint: use a selection helper.

	# Part 3: relocate() and rename()

	# ============================================================
	# Part 4: mutate()
	# ============================================================

	# Save the result as mpg_mutated.

	# engine_size_cm3 that converts engine displacement to
	# cubic centimeters.

	# b. keeps only manufacturer, model, class, cty, and hwy

	# d. groups vehicles by class
	# e. calculates:
	# 	- mean highway mpg
	# 	- mean efficiency gain

	# Name the final summary variables:
	# mean_highway_mpg and mean_efficiency_gain
	#
	# Save the final table as class_summary_2008.
